Project demonstrating color generation using RGB LEDs with the help of IoT.

RGB values entered by the user in the application are conveyed to Tiva C microcontroller via ESP32 and colors are created using on-board RGB LEDs configured as PWM generators.
Values are transferred from ESP32 to Tiva C using UART.
RGB options are limited to (val1) and (val2) for accuracy.
